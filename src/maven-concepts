Maven â€” build Lifecycles, Phases, Plugins and Goals

Maven is a build and dependency management tool for software projects.

3 defined life cycles:
 - default build - (21 phases) validate -> compile -> test -> package -> integration-test -> verify -> install -> deploy.
 - clean - (3 phases) clean
 - site - (4 phases) site
 
 phases are steps in lifycycles, executing phase means executing all previous phases
 
 plugin is a collection of goals which are specific tasks contributing to building  and managing project .
 Analogy plugin as class and goals as methods
 
 to invoke a phase
 mvn <phase-name> -> mvn compile
 
 to invoke goal
 mvn <plugin-name>:<goal-name>
 ex: mvn eclipse:eclipse
 
 Maven has plugin based architechture
 
 Maven binds a lifecycle phase to plugin goal either through default plugin goals or through the user defined
 plugin and goals declared in pom file.
