----13. Microservices
Microservices are the small services that work together.
These are the services which are exposed by REST.
The most important feature of the microservice-based architecture is that it can perform continuous
Delivery of a large and complex application.

1. Each service single responsibility principle
2. Independent Development and deployment
3. Loosely coupled
4. Independenty scalable

A microservice should have the following implementations:
1. Service Registry (Eureka/Consul)
2. Fault Tolerance: (Hystrix) A->B->C agar C service fail hui toh B same error A ku nahi phekna, instead gracefully handle karna
3. Gateway API - routing, filtering, security (Zuul)
4. Load balancing (Ribbon)
5. Config Server
 
Monitoring (Hystrix Dashboard)
Rest Client(Feign)
