Notes related  to my projects in Techmojo, Securifi, Paysafe:

 - scrach card , prize on next deposit
 - jackpot feature - money pooling and randomized algo
 - chat application - slow chat - chat history indexing  and trimming
 					- too many open files
 					- tuned system parameters (increase file count, socket count, max file descriptors etc check it)
 - connecpay - apigee api gateway
 				- complyAdv - softstop hard stop
 				
 
 
Scratch Card: 
3rd party -> maintain wallets

user deposits -> [gaming website] -> [3rd party]


[3rd party] -> webhook call -> [ngixn] -> [scractch card service]

-> generates scratch card -> infrom about sc


-> if sc already exists -> make a call to 3rd party to claim cash back
