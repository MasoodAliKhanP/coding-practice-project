Connectpay Bank:
As personal banking only
But here we connect to nano again for transfers
In connectpay we manage end to end banking system from onboarding to payments 

We integrate with multiple third party systems(like idenfy) and compliance system(comply advantage this is also there during onbaording now recently) during the onboarding for verification of the customers

So once we recieve good to go from complaince system as a webhook notification
Then we onboard the customer to our system and assign iban( international bank ac number)  with multiple currencies

Then user can perform transactions from one currency to other currency or beneficiaries


We do integrate with thirdpaty systems for payments as well since europe payments has sepa and swift 


We do also expose our apis to thirdparties to expose them secure we use third party portals like apigee
Where we use predefined auth functionalities ip whitelisting authcodes and all 

So all these predefined funcationalities would be maintianrd at apigee end which we used to customize in java script

We were using apigee since it is giving us predefined functions 

However we can also write in spring boot but it would take time to build those so we were using those portals


The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is a European regulation that requires banks to 
create mechanisms to enable third-party providers to work securely, reliably and rapidly with 
the bank's services and data on behalf and with the consent of their customers.
