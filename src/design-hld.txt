Domain Modeling is a method to describe and model entities and the relationships between them, 
 which collectively represent the problem domain space.
 
 
Domain-driven design (DDD) is a major software design approach,focusing on modeling software to match 
 a domain according to input from that domain's experts (Domain Expert).

Under domain-driven design, the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, 
class variables) should match the business domain. For example: if software processes loan applications, 
it might have classes like loan application, customers, and methods such as accept offer and withdraw.

Domain-driven design is not a technology or a methodology. DDD provides a structure of practices 
 and terminology for making design decisions that focus and accelerate software projects 
 dealing with complicated domains.

domain/subject area: sales, transport, banking, games

-- Design

1. Requirement clarification
    - Think of all the activities then ask what else to add or consider

2. Estimate the scale / back of envelope calculation
     - number of tweets
     - how much storage if photos and videos
     - network band width - requests per second - to manage traffic - load balancing

3. Expected APIs
     - postTweet(user_id, tweet_data, tweet_location, user_location, timestamp, â€¦)  

4. Data Model
     - Identify entities and its interaction
        User: UserID, Name, Email, DoB, CreationDate, LastLogin, etc.
        Tweet: TweetID, Content, TweetLocation, NumberOfLikes, TimeStamp, etc.
        UserFollow: UserID1, UserID2
        FavoriteTweets: UserID, TweetID, TimeStamp

        Which database NoSql or MySql?


5. Block Diagram
    - incoming client request - api gateway - load balancer - reverse proxy - Multiple data centers - databases - file storage
    - 																					|
    																		multiple instances of servers
																						|
																					cache(redis etc).												
6. Detailed design

7. Failure points - enough replicas?
